<H2>About this Site</H2>
</DIV>
<P>Since the release of <I>Star Wars: A New Hope</I> in 1977, there has been a tremendous amount of interest in the
characters, locations and technology of George Lucas' vision. From the original film's two sequels, <I>The Empire Strikes
Back</I> and <I>Return of the Jedi</I> to the spin-off novels, comics, computer games and even the commemorative Monopoly
set, Star Wars has inspired thousands of science-fiction fans the world over to make their own contributions to an
ever-expanding universe.</P>
<P>The Persistence of Vision raytracer is a program for generating photo-realistic computer images from text files
containing descriptions of 3D scenes or objects. It is available for most computer platforms, it is freely distributable,
and it can produce some stunning-looking images - take a look at <A HREF="http://www.povray.org">www.povray.org</A> for
more information and details of how to get hold of POV-Ray for your own computer.</P>
<P>I created this site in 1998, having put together a few SW models just for fun. Most of
the original models were mine, although there have been numerous contributions since this
site went 'live.' I haven't done anything in POV-Ray for years now - not enough time, and I kind
of lost interest after a while - but I had so many emails regarding this site that I felt it
was worth leaving it on-line, and I'll happily post SW POV-Ray stuff that other people have
developed.</P>
<P>My personal homepage is at <A HREF="http://www.dylanbeattie.net/">http://www.dylanbeattie.net/</A>.</P>
