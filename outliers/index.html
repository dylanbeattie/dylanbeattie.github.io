<h2>A Toast to the Outliers</h2>
<p>
    As 2016 loses another celebrity, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on on this whole weird relationship between celebrity and old age. I, and everyone else in my generation,
    grew up in an age of legends. Leaders. Pioneers. Heroes. Rock stars. Movie stars. People who <strong>ACTUALLY WALKED ON THE MOON.</strong>
    And now, our childhood heroes are old. And, yes, they'll die. We'll celebrate their work, and mourn their passing, and reflect on the fact that no matter how amazing
    the body of work they left behind, there's probably somebody, somewhere, who's glad they're dead, and good riddance.
</p>
<p>
    But old people getting sick and dying isn't news - it's nature. What I think is
    amazing is the outliers. Take a look at the list below. I've scraped data on famous
    people born throughout the 20th century from <a href="http://www.biography.com/">http://www.biography.com/</a>,
    filtered it
    down to the people who are still alive, and cross-referenced that against the average
    life expectancy, adjusted for year of birth, taken from Figure 2 at
    <a href="http://demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/">demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918</a>
</p>
<p><strong>This is a list of people who should be dead already - but they're not.</strong></p>
<p>This list isn't filtered. It's a raw dump of statistical data and potted biographes. But take a look. Marvel at how many of them are not just still alive, but still working - writing, campaigning, acting, performing. Think of how many amazing stories, films, songs and ideas we'd have missed out on if they'd all died when the stats said they would.</p>
<p>And when the time comes for them to pass, as it inevitably will, don't act surprised. Time's a bitch, and it'll get us all in the end :)</p>
